    "#### A Southern-Franced based coffee shop chain (named 'allo Café) reached out to get advice on how to place their planned coffee shops in Paris. \n",
    "They do not have any shop in Paris or near the capital area yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main goal: to identify the two best areas that would fit 'allo Café's criteria and where the chain should open their first two shops in Paris. \n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria and aspects learnt upon the first consultation: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 'allo café wants to open two shops but in two distinct districts \n",
    "- Based on their experience, they gen achieve higher returns at locations where people like traditional French cuisine and bakery \n",
    "- They do not want to be surrounded by many competing stores from the exact same category, but some 'café culture' is necessary \n",
    "- Eventually they want to open at least three shops in one of the identified areas, so there needs to be enough room for it \n",
    "- For the second store, they seek to 'try out something new', and would prefer to put the shop in the vicinity of parks/outdoor activities (they do not want to expand more in this area) \n",
    "- Price is an important consideration. They are willing to pay more for a better area, but will minimise the price within the area if a given district within the area offers lower rental prices \n",
